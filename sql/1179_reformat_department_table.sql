/*
Explanation:
The CASE statement extracts the revenue for each month.
MAX() ensures that only one value is selected for each (id, month) combination.
Grouping by id ensures that each department gets one row in the final output.

Time Complexity
O(n) → Since we scan the table once and group by id.
Space Complexity
O(1) → We only return a transformed table without extra storage.
