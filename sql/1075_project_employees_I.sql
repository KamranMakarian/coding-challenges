/*
Correct Time Complexity
JOIN Operation:
The INNER JOIN on employee_id runs in O(n log n) or O(n) depending on indexing.
If employee_id is indexed, then it runs in O(n).
GROUP BY & Aggregation:
Sorting-based aggregation is O(n log n).
Hash-based aggregation is O(n) (if hashing is used).
âœ… Final Complexity:
ðŸ”¹ Best case (Indexed): O(n)
ðŸ”¹ Worst case (Sorting needed): O(n log n)

Space Complexity
Since we're only storing one aggregated row per project_id, the space complexity is O(p), where p is the number of projects.
Your estimate of O(n) is too high because n is the number of employees, not projects.
âœ… Final Space Complexity: O(p)
